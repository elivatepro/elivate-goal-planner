📃

- Past Month = A
- New Month = B

You set and send your believe goal between the 15th of month A and the 1st of month B for a review by your team leader. You start working and sowing the seed of the goal starting that same 15th of the month A, you don’t stop working/sowing. On the 15th of the month B, you set and send your affirmation goal, that means you have had 30 days to work on the believe goal you have set. So your affirmation goal is what exactly will be the result of the efforts you have put in for the past 30 days in your believe goal.
